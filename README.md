Code Refractor Challenge

## Description

The first changed were in the index.html they were very important.
There was a big change for the different elements in the html.
First Changes were that the content area was under a div, which was later changed to
a <section> element used for more accessible html content.
Later many classes were also renamed to not need to be repeated
an example of this would be the new class "section-content" the unique change 
helped shorten many lines of css code. We were able to fit some img, and h2 code without taking up 
a lot of space.

The CSS had some significant changes making it much more accessible.
Some of the first changes was that comments were added to be able to recognize which area 
we are editing on the css. The other very important change was that the amount of code 
lines were reduced significantly. Many html classes and and elements were able to be condensed into 
shorter and easier to read css code.

Some Errors were also fixed the main one was that the search-engine-optimization section 
did not have an id tag to it's name. Which came into a problem when pressing the 
button on the navigation area to go there. The problem was that when you press the button
on the navigation area it only sent you to the image of the Horiseon meeting.
Not of the section which it should of brought the user to. The issue was resolved an id was added.

Overall, the site has become much more accessible then it was previously, along with many minor touches
to make the code work as well as possible.
